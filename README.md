# MiniGPT – Character-Level GPT from Scratch

This project is a **mini GPT-style language model** implemented and trained **from scratch** using PyTorch.  
The model is trained on the **Tiny Shakespeare dataset** and generates Shakespeare-like text **character by character**

This project is inspired by understanding how GPT models work internally, rather than using pre-trained libraries.

## 🔹 Training Details

- Dataset: Tiny Shakespeare
- Training split: 90%
- Validation split: 10%
- Total iterations: ~5000
- Hardware: Local machine (limited GPU memory)

The model was trained until both training and validation loss stabilized.
